<p>Pai Hsien-Yung's New Yorkers</p>
<p>Pai Hsien-Yung’s work in “New Yorkers”, penned between 1965 and 2003, offers a poignant exploration of the lives of Chinese individuals navigating their new lives in the foreign city. Pai Hsien-Yung's work serves as a cultural and historical artifact as the stories explore themes such as displacement, cultural tension, and identity amidst the ongoing tussle between Chinese traditions and Western influence. Due to a number of political and cultural reasons, despite the valuable insight it provides, "New Yorkers" remains relatively underrecognized, particularly among the newer generations of Mainland Chinese navigating their own realities in the city—which, in my personal view, is such a shame, as members of the community might very well find that Pai’s work often mirrors their own experiences. </p>

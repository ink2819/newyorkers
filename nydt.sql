But this time her diamond spider had slid down almost to the end of the flowing mane around her left shoulder, swaying there as if it were suspended from some invisible filament. It was altogether striking.', 1, 1),
('周大庆早在Tavern on the Green里等我们。他新理了头发，耳际上两条发线修得十分整齐。他看见我们时立刻站了起来，脸上笑得有点僵硬，还像在大学里站在女生宿舍门口等候舞伴那么紧张。', 'Chou Ta-ch''ing had been waiting for us for some time at the Tavern-on-the-Green. He had just had his hair cut, and looked overly trim. He got up as soon as he saw us, with a stiff smile on his face, seemingly still as nervous as when, back in his college days, he had waited outside the girls'' dormitory to take his date to a dance.', 2, 1),
('张嘉行结婚，李彤替她做伴娘。李彤消瘦了不少，可是在人堆子里，还是那么突出，那么扎眼。招待会是在王医生Central Park West上的大公寓里举行的，王医生的社交很广，与会的人很多，两个大厅都挤得满满的，李彤从人堆里闪到我跟前要我陪她出去走走', 'The reception was held in Dr. Wang''s luxurious apartment on Central Park West; with his wide connections, little wonder that he had so many well-wishers gathered in the living room and dining room. Pushing through the crowd, Li T''ung came near me and asked me to take her out for a walk.', 11, 1),
('我问她是不是还住在Village里，她说已经搬了三次家了。谈笑间，李彤已经喝下去三杯Manhattan。', 'I asked her if she still lived on Lexington Avenue. She laughed and said she had moved three times since I had last seen her. She had already gulped down three drinks during our talk and her face was beginning to turn red.', 15, 1),
('当车子开进Times Square的当儿，我发觉慧芬坐在我旁边哭泣起来了。我侧过头去看她，她僵挺挺地坐着，脸朝着前方一动也不动，睁着一双眼睛，空茫失神地直视着，泪水一条条从她眼里淌了出来，她没有去揩拭，任其一滴滴掉落到她的胸前', 'When our car got near Times Square, I suddenly found that Hui-fen was weeping.

('Riverdale附近，全是一式酱色陈旧的公寓房子。这是个星期天，住户们都在睡早觉，街上一个人也看不见，两旁的房子，上上下下，一排排的窗户全遮上了黄色的帘子，好像许多双挖去了瞳仁的大眼睛，互相空白地瞪视着。每家房子的前方都悬了一架锯齿形的救火梯，把房面切成了迷宫似的图样。梯子都积了雪，好像那一根根黑铁上，突然生出了许多白毛来。太阳升过了屋顶，照得一条街通亮，但是空气寒冽，鲜明的阳光，没有丝毫暖意。', 'Near Riverdale, all the apartment buildings were uniform in their mustard color, showing signs of age. It was a Sunday morning, and the residents were likely still asleep, with no one visible on the street. The apartment buildings, tall and lined up, had their windows covered with yellow curtains, giving the impression of many blank, staring eyes without pupils. Each building had an angular fire escape in front, making the façade resemble a labyrinthine design. The fire escapes were covered in snow, looking as though white hair had suddenly sprouted on the black iron. The sun rose over the rooftops, brightening the street, but the air was crisp, and the bright sunlight carried no warmth.', 21, 1),

('夜渐深的时分，纽约的风雪愈来愈大。在St.Mark’s Plaza的上空，那些密密麻麻的霓虹灯光，让纷纷落下的雪花，织成了一张七彩晶艳的珠网。黄凤仪从计程车里跳了出来，两手护住头，便钻进了第六街Rendezvous的地下室里去。里面早挤满了人，玫瑰色的灯光中，散满了乳白的烟色。', 'Later that night, the snowstorm in New York worsens. Above St. Mark’s Plaza, the densely packed and glowing neon lights turn the falling snowflakes into a sparkling rainbow web. Huang Fengyi hops out of a cab, both hands covering her head, and makes her way into The Rendezvous, located in a basement on Sixth Avenue. The place is already packed and milk-white cigarette smoke rises in the rose-colored light.', 4, 2),
('戴着太阳眼镜在Times Square的人潮中，让人家推着走的时候，抬起头看见那些摩天大楼，一排排在往后退，我觉得自己只有一点丁儿那么大了。淹没在这个成千万人的大城中，我觉得得到了真正的自由：一种独来独往，无人理会的自由', 'Wearing sunglasses amid the crowds in Times Square, being pushed along by others, and looking up at those skyscrapers, receding, row upon row, into the distance, makes me feel so insignificant. Buried in a city of millions, I feel I have attained true freedom—a kind of independence, a freedom from being noticed by anyone.', 19, 2),
('有一天，几个朋友载我到纽约近郊Westchester一个阔人住宅区去玩。我走过一幢花园别墅时，突然站住了脚。那是一幢很华丽的楼房，花园非常大，园里有一个白铁花棚，棚架上爬满了葡萄。园门敞开着，我竟忘情地走了进去，踱到了那个花棚下面。棚架上垂着一串串碧绿的葡萄子，非常可爱。', 'One day, some friends of mine took me to Westchester, a rich neighborhood near New York. As I was passing a well-landscaped mansion, I suddenly stopped in my tracks. It was a magnificent place with a huge garden in which there was a white, wrought-iron arbor covered with grape vines. The garden gate was open, so without thinking, I walked in and strolled over under the arbor. Clusters of bluish grapes hung from the arbor and looked quite delightful. I sat down alone on a stone bench there, and lost myself in thought for a long time.', 23, 2),

From his vantage point, he has an unobstructed view of the scenery along the park''s western avenue. It''s an afternoon in late autumn, just after Thanksgiving, and the weather has turned chilly. The trees in the park, once lush with summer greenery, have suddenly lost most of their leaves, revealing many dark and gnarled branches. Outside the park, the row of old elm trees along the pedestrian path has leaves that have turned a scorched yellow, falling to the ground and rolling in the autumn breeze. Pedestrians on the path are dressed in autumn wear, with long skirts that are fashionable this year dragging on the ground in shades of coffee, bronze, gold, and cream. The ladies, elegant and graceful, sweep by, and with them, a sense of autumn splendor emerges on the western avenue. In this time when autumn wanes and winter approaches, Manhattan in New York indeed possesses a relaxed and comfortable elegance that follows its hustle and bustle, offering a spacious and delightful experience for the soul', 1, 3),
('刘伟却安静得多了，他人小，五短身材，戴着一副酒瓶底那么厚的近视眼镜，等他们争罢了，他才慢条斯理地耸耸眼镜，说道：“肥料，中国现在最需要的，就是化学肥料！”','Liu Wei, however, was much quieter. He was short and stocky, wearing a pair of nearsighted glasses as thick as the bottom of a wine bottle. After the others had finished arguing, he slowly adjusted his glasses and said methodically, "Fertilizer, what China needs most now is chemical fertilizer!"', 2, 2),
('此外，在长岛的East Hampton上，他还购买了一幢海滨别墅，周末可以出城去度假。他常带了珮琪和大卫，到别墅的海滨去游泳打球，或者干脆躺在沙滩上晒一个下午的太阳，全家人都晒得红头赤脸回来，把大城里的苍白都晒掉。','Moreover, he purchased a seaside villa in East Hampton on Long Island, where he could go for weekend getaways out of the city. He often took Peiqi and David to the villa''s beach for swimming and playing ball, or simply to lie on the sand and bask in the sun for an afternoon. The whole family would return home sunburned, shedding the pallor of the big city life.', 18, 3),
('上次珮琪来找他，商量大卫明年上哈佛大学的事宜，他请她到五十七街那家白俄餐馆Russian Tearoom去吃俄国大菜，基辅鸡，两个人三杯“凡亚舅舅”下肚，竟谈得兴高采烈起来——从前两夫妻在一块儿，到了末期，三天竟找不出两句话——珮琪滔滔不绝，谈到她那位炒房地产的男朋友，容光焕发','Last time Peggy came to see him to discuss David''s admission to Harvard University next year, he invited her to the Russian Tea Room on 57th Street for a Russian feast, including Chicken Kiev. After three rounds of ''Uncle Vanya'' cocktails, they found themselves talking excitedly — a contrast to the later days of their marriage when they could hardly find two words to say to each other over three days. Peiqi spoke non-stop, glowing as she talked about her real estate investor boyfriend', 25, 3),

After she finished playing the ''Heroic Polonaise'', she lifted her hands gracefully, and the applause from the audience continued for several minutes. The largest bouquet on the stage, with hundreds of white chrysanthemums, was sent by him', 30, 3);
